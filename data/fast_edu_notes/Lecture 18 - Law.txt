Law and Ethics
§ When Law tells us to do or not to do something, it implies that a recognized authority 
has decided that the action that allows or prohibits is of benefit to the society in 
someway.
§ It often happens that an ethical principle was used prior to a laws construction.
Example: a generally accepted ethical principle that we should help others in need leads 
to a Good Samaritan Laws that protect the right of individuals who help an injured 
person. 
§ The fact that Law is grounded in ethical principles makes law a good starting point for 
ethical decision making.
