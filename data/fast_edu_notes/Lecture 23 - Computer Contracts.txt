Computer Contracts
What is a Contract?
§ An agreement is a set of mutual promises made between parties, but not necessarily 
enforceable
§ A contract is an agreement recognized by law, meaning courts can enforce its 
performance
§ Contracts can be between natural persons or legal entities such as companies
§ No specific format is required, the focus is on the intent to create legal obligations
§ Each party must receive or give something of value, forming the consideration that 
supports the contract
Contract 
vs.
Agreement
1.
Offer: A clear proposal showing willingness to enter a legally 
binding arrangement
2.
Acceptance: An unequivocal agreement to the offer's terms
3.
Awareness: An understanding of the terms and conditions 
4.
Consideration: Something of value exchanged between the 
parties, such as money, goods, services, or promises to act 
(or refrain from acting) in a certain way
5.
Capacity: The legal capacity of all parties involved to 
authorize a deal on behalf of the company
6.
Legality: The purpose of the contract must be lawful — a 
contract cannot be formed with the intention to carry out an 
illegal act
Essential Elements of a Valid Contract
Why Computer Contracts are Unique?
§ Intangible Nature of Software: Software cannot be physically inspected like hardware, 
making quality, performance, and completeness harder to verify.
§ Ambiguous Requirements: Many IT projects start with unclear or evolving 
specifications, increasing the chance of misunderstandings and scope disputes.
§ Intellectual Property Challenges: Ownership of source code, documentation, 
algorithms, and design assets must be explicitly defined to avoid future conflicts.
§ Operational Dependency: A system failure can halt payroll, billing, logistics, or public 
services, causing significant financial or reputation damage.
§ Rapid Technological Change: Hardware and software can become outdated quickly, 
requiring upgrades, migrations, or renegotiations during the contract.
§ Integration Complexity: IT systems must work with existing databases, servers, 
networks, and third-party tools, increasing risk if not properly planned.
§ Higher Risk of Disputes: Vague deliverables, undefined acceptance criteria, and poor 
documentation frequently lead to disagreements and blame-shifting.
§ Security & Compliance Requirements: Contracts must address security, data 
protection, backups, and audit requirements, especially when dealing with sensitive data.
Key Questions in Assessing IT Contracts
§ What if the software has defects?
Determine warranty terms, bug-fix responsibilities, and limits of liability.
§ What if the system fails during critical operations?
Contracts must define support response times, backup plans, and disaster recovery 
procedures.
§ What if the client misuses or illegally distributes the software?
Licensing terms must clearly restrict copying, sharing, or unauthorized modification.
§ What if performance is too slow or below expectations?
Include measurable benchmarks, performance tests, and acceptance criteria.
§ What if the system becomes outdated or unsupported?
Define upgrade options, long-term maintenance, and vendor obligations.
§ What happens if third-party IP is violated?
Indemnity clauses determine who bears responsibility for IP infringement.
Case Study: Ministry of Information vs Faujisoft (2001)
Project Details
§ Rs 1.1 million project
§ MIS with 4 modules: Personnel, Inventory, 
Accounts, News Archiving
Requirements & Contract Issues
§ No formal requirements / specifications 
were provided by the Ministry
§ Faujisoft itself studied and proposed a 
system
§ Contract was developed by Faujisoft and 
approved without consultation of the 
Ministry of Law
Financial Aspects
§ Faujisoft got money in advance (initial 
stages)
§ Rs 0.550 million bank guarantee was there 
(6-months validity)
§ Oracle 8 was purchased (licensed) from 
Ora-Tech, 2 DBA’s trained
Delivery Problems
§ Software delivered was full of bugs
§ Not meeting user requirements
§ Could not get implemented
Contractual Consequences
§ As per contract / terms & conditions, 
nothing could be claimed
§ Poor Contract -> how much loss of public 
money?

Purpose of Contracts
§ Contracts set out the agreement between the parties
§ They define the aims of the parties and expectations
§ They address issues that may arise during the contract
§ They outline how the contract can be terminated
§ They specify the consequences of termination
§ Contracts provide legal security to both the customer and software developers
§ Gaps may exist when parties fail to consider specific issues
§ Contracts rarely cause disputes when everything runs smoothly, but when things go 
wrong, problems arise
§ Example often used: Marriage, where disputes appear only when expectations fail
Structure of the Contract (Introductory Section)
§ The first part of the contract is brief and formal
§ It states that it is an agreement between the parties, along with their names and 
registered addresses
§ It usually begins with a definitions section
§ Definitions clarify how certain terms will be used throughout the contract
Example:
§ Company X Ltd, the software house, is defined as “The Company”
§ Company Y Ltd, the client commissioning the work, is defined as “The Client”
Structure of the Contract (Clause Section)
1. What is to be produced?
It is clearly necessary that the contract states what is to be produced.
Refers to a separate document which constitutes the requirements 
specification.
§ Software engineers will be familiar with the problems of producing 
requirements
§ A specification sets out the detailed requirements of the client. Ideally, the
§ Specification should be complete, consistent and accurate and set out all that 
the client 
§ Wants to be done in the performance of the contract
Structure of the Contract (Clause Section)
2. What is to be delivered?
Producing software for a client is not, usually, a matter of simply handing over the 
text of a program which does what is required.
The following is a non-exhaustive list of possibilities:
§ Source code;
§ Command files for building the executable code from the source and for 
installing it;
§ Documentation of the design and of the code;
§ Reference manuals, training manuals and operations manuals;
§ Software tools to help maintain the code;
§ User training;
§ Training for the client’s maintenance staff;
§ Test data and test results.
Structure of the Contract (Clause Section)
3. Ownership of rights
It is important that the contract should also state just what legal rights are being 
passed the software house to the client under the contract. Ownership in physical 
items such as books, documents or discs will usually pass from the software house 
to the client, but other intangible rights, known as intellectual property rights.
It is important for the contract to state precisely who is to own these rights. Do 
they pass to the client or are they retained by the software house?
Structure of the Contract (Clause Section)
4. Confidentiality
A second area of intellectual property law which should be considered in a 
software contract is confidentiality. The commissioning client may well have to 
pass confidential information about its business operations to the software house. 
On the other side of the coin, the software house may not want the client to 
divulge to others details of the program content or other information gleaned 
about its operations by the client.
Structure of the Contract (Clause Section)
5. Obligations of the client
In almost all cases where work is being carried out for a specific client, the client 
will have to fulfil certain obligations if the contract is to be completed successfully. 
The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of possibilities:
§ provide documentation on aspects of the client’s activities or the environment in 
which the system will run;
§ provide access to appropriate members of staff;
§ provide machine facilities for development and testing;
§ provide accommodation, telephone and secretarial facilities for the company’s 
staff
§ when working on the client’s premises;
§ provide data communications facilities to the site.
Structure of the Contract (Clause Section)
6. Standards and methods of working
The supplier is likely to have company standards, methods of working, quality 
assurance procedures, etc. and will normally prefer to use these. More 
sophisticated clients will have their own procedures and may require that these be 
adhered to.
In some cases, the supplier may be required to allow the client to apply quality 
control procedures to the project. The contract must specify which is to apply.
Structure of the Contract (Clause Section)
7. Project Managers
Each party needs to know who, of the other party’s staff, has day-to- day 
responsibility for the work and what the limits of that person’s authority are. The 
standard terms and conditions should therefore require each party to nominate, in 
writing, a Project Manager.
The Project Managers must have at least the authority necessary to fulfil the 
obligations which the contract places on them. It is particularly important that the 
limits of their financial authority are explicitly stated, i.e. the extent to which they 
can authorize changes to the cost of the contract.
Structure of the Contract (Clause Section)
8. Acceptance procedure
Acceptance procedures are a critical part of contract for they provide the criteria 
by which successful completion of the contract is judged.
The essence of the acceptance procedure is that the client should provide a fixed 
set of acceptance tests and expected results and that successful performance of 
these tests shall constitute acceptance of the system.
Structure of the Contract (Clause Section)
9. Indemnity
It could happen that, as a result of the client’s instructions, the supplier is led 
unwittingly to infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party or that, 
through carelessness or dishonesty, the supplier provides a system which infringes 
such rights—perhaps through using proprietary software as a component of the 
system delivered. For this reason, it is advisable to include a clause under which 
each party indemnifies the other for liability arising from its own faults in this 
respect.
Structure of the Contract (Clause Section)
10. Termination of the contract
§ There are many reasons why it may become necessary to terminate a contract 
before it has been completed.
For example, for the client to be taken over by another company which already has 
a system of the type being developed, or for a change in policy on the part of the 
client to mean that the system is no longer relevant to its needs
§ The contract makes provision for terminating the work in an amicable manner
Structure of the Contract (Clause Section)
11. Arbitration
If the event of a dispute that cannot be resolved by the parties themselves, they 
agree to accept the decision of an independent arbitrator.
12. Inflation
In lengthy projects or projects where there is a commitment to long term 
maintenance, the supplier will wish to ensure protection against the effects of 
unpredictable inflation.
To handle this problem, it is customary to include a clause which allows charges to 
be increased in accordance with the rise in costs.
Structure of the Contract (Clause Section)
13. Applicable law
Where the supplier and the client have their registered offices in different legal 
jurisdictions or performance of the contract involves more than one jurisdiction, it 
is necessary to state under which laws the contract is to be interpreted.
Structure of the Contract (Authority Section)
§ The authorities of both party signature on the term and conditions mentioned 
in the clause section.
§ The most Important things are Starting and ending date of an Agreement.
§ Only an Authorized person from each party is mentioned in this Section.
