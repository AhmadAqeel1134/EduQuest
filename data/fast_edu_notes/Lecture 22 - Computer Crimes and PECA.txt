Computer Crimes, Cyber Offences, 
and PECA 2016
What Is a Computer Crime?
A computer crime is any unlawful activity in which a computer, digital device, or network is used as 
a tool, a target, or a storage medium for committing the offence.
How computers enable crime
§ Allow criminals to automate, scale, and hide activities
§ Enable attacks across borders with minimal cost
§ Allow anonymous or spoofed identities
§ Increase speed and impact of offences
Three ways computers are involved
§ Computer as a Tool: Using a system to commit fraud, phishing, ransomware, online scams.
§ Computer as a Target: Hacking servers, stealing data, DDoS attacks, unauthorized access.
§ Computer as Evidence Storage: Logs, chat messages, emails, databases.
Why cybercrime grows
“Because that’s where the money is” (Willie Sutton).

9. Ransomware (Modern Attacks + Pakistan 
examples)
10. Identity Theft (From both decks)
Footprinting & Reconnaissance
What Is Footprinting?
Gathering detailed information about 
a target’s:
§ Systems
§ People
§ Networks
§ Software
§ Online footprint
§ Vulnerabilities
Before launching an attack.
This is also known as 
OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence).
What Attackers Look For
§ Domain names, subdomains, DNS records
§ IP ranges and server locations
§ Tech stack (frameworks, CMS, cloud 
provider)
§ Leaked credentials from data breaches
§ Visible software versions with known 
exploits
§ Employee details (LinkedIn, GitHub, social 
media)
§ Emails, PDFs, invoices with metadata
§ Public GitHub repos with API keys or 
passwords
§ Company news, RFPs, job ads revealing 
stack
Technical Footprinting: Mapping the Target’s Infrastructure
1. Domain & Server Discovery
Fetch domain records using WHOIS
§
Identify email and web server IP 
addresses
§
Determine whether servers are 
self-hosted or cloud-hosted
§
Obtain hosting provider and 
physical location (if available)
4. Public Archive & Metadata 
Analysis
§
Wayback Machine snapshots
§
Old company pages and HR 
changes
§
Vendor announcements and tech 
migrations
§
Metadata in PDFs/docs revealing 
server info or usernames
3. Port Scanning & Firewall Mapping
Used to detect open services:
§
Port 110 → POP3 mail server
§
Ports 137, 138, 139 → Windows 
NetBIOS services
§
Port 22 → SSH
§
Port 443 → HTTPS
§
Open ports show running services 
and possible vulnerabilities.
2. Netcraft Analysis (netcraft.com)
Reveals:
§
Web server type (Apache, Nginx, 
IIS)
§
Operating system
§
Uptime and time since last reboot
§
Technology stack and software 
versions
§
Historical snapshots of the site
5. Security Tools for Recon
Tools originally meant for admins can 
be misused:
Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer
Vulnerability assessment tools
These reveal configuration 
weaknesses, missing patches, and 
insecure services.
Password Attacks
1. Brute-Force Attacks
Trying every possible 
password combination
§
Automated tools
§
Fast with GPUs
§
Easily detected due 
to repeated failures
3. Credential Stuffing
Using leaked username–
password pairs from 
previous data breaches
§
Works because people 
reuse passwords
§
Highly automated
§
Used heavily in fintech 
and e-commerce 
attacks
4. Password Spraying
Trying one common 
password across many 
accounts
Avoids account lockouts
2. Dictionary Attacks
Using lists of common or 
predictable passwords
Examples:
admin123, pakistan1, 
qwerty, welcome2024
5. Social Engineering Password Theft
§
Fake password reset emails
§
WhatsApp OTP scams
§
Fake bank calls
§
AI voice cloning
§
Fake “verification” messages
No hacking needed, only human manipulation.
6. Offline Hash Cracking
If attackers obtain hashed 
passwords, they use tools 
to crack them:
§
Hashcat
§
John the Ripper
§
OphCrack
7. Physical Access 
Attacks
§
Booting device with a 
Linux USB
§
Using USB payloads 
(Rubber Ducky)
§
Accessing unlocked 
systems
Website Attacks: SQL Injection (SQLi)
SQL Injection is one of the most dangerous and common web vulnerabilities.
It occurs when attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields or URLs to manipulate 
the database.
How SQL Injection Works
Poorly validated input is sent directly to the database, allowing attackers to:
§ Bypass login
§ Access private data
§ Modify or delete records
§ Download entire databases
§ Execute admin-level commands
§ Create new user accounts
Website Attacks: SQL Injection (SQLi)
Classic Login Bypass Example
Modern SQL Injection Examples (2025)
§ ' OR '1'='1
§ ' UNION SELECT email, password FROM users--
§ Blind SQLi payloads to extract data slowly
§ Automated tools (SQLmap, Havij)
Why SQLi Still Happens
§ Developers trust user input
§ Weak validation
§ Outdated frameworks
§ Direct string concatenation
§ Copy-pasted insecure code from 
StackOverflow
Website Attacks: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript into a website 
viewed by other users.
This can compromise accounts, steal data, or hijack sessions.
How XSS Works
When a site fails to sanitize user input, malicious code is executed in the victim’s browser.
Example Payload
Website Attacks: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Types of XSS
1. Reflected XSS
Malicious script delivered through URL or form input.
Used in phishing attacks.
2. Stored XSS
Malicious code saved in comments, profiles, messages.
More dangerous because every viewer is affected.
3. DOM-Based XSS
Vulnerability in client-side JavaScript.
Common in modern frameworks and SPAs.
Modern Real-World Examples
§ Facebook, Google, and Twitter 
all patched XSS vulnerabilities
§ XSS is among top issues in 
OWASP Top 10 (2021–2025)
§ Attackers use automated 
scanners to detect it
Session Hijacking
Session hijacking is the act of taking over an active user session after obtaining or 
predicting the session ID.
The attacker becomes the victim without needing their password.
How Sessions Work
When a user logs in, the server creates a session ID stored in:
§ Cookies
§ URL parameters (older systems)
§ Local storage (modern SPAs)
If an attacker gets that ID, they can impersonate the user.
Session Hijacking - Techniques Used for Session Hijacking
1. Stealing Session IDs
§ XSS stealing cookies
§ Packet sniffing on insecure Wi-Fi
§ MITM attacks
§ Compromised browser extensions
§ Malware/keyloggers
§ Logs left on public machines
2. Predicting or Calculating Session IDs
Weak session generation can allow:
§ Guessing sequential IDs
§ Replaying old sessions
3. Brute-forcing Session IDs
Trying many possible IDs until one works
(rare today but still possible for poorly designed systems)
Real-World Examples
§ Firesheep browser extension 
exposed insecure Wi-Fi sessions
§ Several banking apps were 
found vulnerable due to 
insecure token handling
§ Web apps with “Remember Me” 
tokens stored insecurely
Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks
A Man-in-the-Middle attack happens when an attacker secretly intercepts communication 
between two parties and reads, modifies, or injects data.
The victim believes they are communicating securely, but the attacker sits quietly in the 
middle.
How MITM Works
The attacker splits the communication into two connections:
1. Victim → Attacker
2. Attacker → Server
They act as a proxy, controlling everything in between.
Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks – Common Methods
1. Wi-Fi MITM
Fake “Free Wi-Fi” hotspots
Intercepting unencrypted traffic
Capturing session cookies
2. ARP Spoofing
Telling the network:
“I am the router.”
All traffic flows through the attacker.
3. DNS Spoofing
Redirecting users to a fake website
Example:
Fake banking page → steals credentials
4. HTTPS Downgrade Attacks
Tricking the website into loading over HTTP
Once unencrypted, data becomes readable.
5. SSL Stripping
Removing encryption during transmission
Victim sees “http” even for sensitive pages.
Real-World Examples
§
Public Wi-Fi attacks in cafes and airports
§
Corporate espionage via ARP spoofing
§
Intercepting cloud credentials
§
Fake banking pages used in Pakistan
Network Sniffing & Tools
Network sniffing is the process of capturing and analyzing data packets moving through a 
network.
Attackers use sniffers to harvest passwords, session cookies, files, and private messages.
What Is a Sniffer?
A sniffer is a tool that:
§ Monitors network packets
§ Records data passing through the network
§ Extracts meaningful information (credentials, content, metadata)
Sniffing is difficult to detect because it copies packets without interrupting them.
Popular Tools: Wireshark, tcpdump, Ettercap, Cain & Abel / Packet Sniffers, Cloud-Based 
Sniffers
Network Sniffing & Tools
Legitimate Uses (Ethical Context)
§ Troubleshooting network issues
§ Security audits
§ Performance analysis
§ Forensics
For example: the FBI’s controversial mass-monitoring tool Carnivore) can even rebuild files 
sent across a network, such as an e-mail or Web page
Malware: Viruses, Worms, Trojans
Malware is software created to damage, steal, or gain unauthorized access to systems.
1. Viruses
Attach to files and spread when executed.
Can corrupt data or operating systems.
Example: Brain Virus (1986) from Lahore, Pakistan, 
infected floppy disk boot sectors.
2. Worms
Self-replicate across networks without user action.
Cause large-scale disruption and bandwidth overload.
3. Trojans
Disguised as legitimate apps.
Open backdoors, spy, or steal credentials.
Other Common Types
§ Spyware / Keyloggers – 
monitor user activity
§ Botnets – networks of infected 
devices
§ Fileless malware – runs in 
memory only
§ Mobile malware – malicious 
apps / modified APKs
Ransomware
Ransomware encrypts files or systems and demands payment (usually cryptocurrency) to restore 
access. t is one of the most damaging cybercrimes today.
How Ransomware Works
1.
Infection
Phishing emails, stolen passwords, insecure RDP/SSH, malicious downloads.
2.
Encryption
Files, databases, or entire servers are locked.
3.
Ransom Demand
Payment requested in crypto, often with threat of data leak.
Modern Trends
§ Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), anyone can buy attack kits
§ Double/Triple Extortion: encrypt + steal + threaten to publish
§ Targeting critical systems (banks, hospitals, govt)
§ Cloud ransomware affecting S3, cloud DBs, backups
Identity Theft
Identity theft occurs when someone steals or uses another person’s personal 
information without consent to commit fraud or impersonation.
It is one of the fastest-growing cybercrimes in Pakistan and worldwide.

Cybercriminals exploit online marketplaces 
and auction platforms by manipulating bids 
or deceiving buyers.
Common Fraud Techniques
1. Shill Bidding
Seller (or friends) bid on their own item to 
inflate the price.
2. Bid Shielding
A low real bid is protected by two fake high 
bids.
Fake bidders withdraw at the last moment, 
forcing the seller to accept the low bid.
3. Bid Siphoning
Criminals lure buyers off the legitimate site 
with a “cheaper offer” and disappear after 
receiving payment.
4. Fake Listings & Phantom Items 
(Modern)
Scammers list items they do not own on OLX, 
Daraz, Facebook Marketplace.

§ Pornography & Child Exploitation (Non-graphic, legal framing)
§ Hate Speech, Defamation, Fake News
§ Jurisdiction Issues: International vs Pakistan (Extradition, extraterritorial jurisdiction)
Internet Harassment & Cyberstalking
Cyberstalking involves using digital tools to 
harass, monitor, threaten, or intimidate 
someone.
It is one of the most common cybercrimes 
affecting students.
Forms of Cyber Harassment

Illegal Content & Child Protection
Criminals use the internet to create, share, or distribute 
harmful and illegal content.
These offences cause long-term psychological, social, 
and reputational damage.
1. Prohibited Online Content
§
Pornographic or explicit content involving minors
§
Sharing private images/videos without consent
§
Posting deepfakes to harm or humiliate someone
§
Graphic or abusive material targeting individuals
§
Fake screenshots, edited conversations, or 
manipulated media
2. Child Exploitation Risks

Manipulating or grooming through social media or 
games
§
Coercing children into sending images
§
Photoshopping a minor’s face onto explicit content
§
Tricking minors using fake profiles
§
Recording or distributing minors’ private moments
These crimes cause severe emotional trauma and can 
spread uncontrollably online.
3. Why Illegal Content Is a Major Cybercrime Issue
§
Uploaded content becomes permanent online
§
Search engines and social platforms amplify reach
§
Victims have little control once content leaks
§
AI tools make manipulation 
(deepfakes/photoshops) easier
§
Even “jokes” or “pranks” can escalate into serious 
consequences
Hate Speech, Defamation & Fake News
The internet amplifies harmful 
content that can damage 
reputations, divide communities, or 
create public unrest.
1. Hate Speech
Publishing or spreading content that 
attacks individuals or groups based 
on:
§
Religion
§
Ethnicity
§
Nationality
§
Sect or community
§
Race or cultural identity
Hate speech online can trigger real-
world violence, harassment, or social 
division.
2. Defamation
Sharing false statements that:
§
Damage someone’s reputation
§
Cause public humiliation
§
Harm academic, professional, or 
social standing
Examples:
Fake accusations
Edited screenshots
Rumors spread through WhatsApp 
or social media
False allegations published in posts 
or videos
3. Fake News & Misinformation
Intentionally or accidentally 
spreading false information:
§
Altered videos/images
§

narratives
4. Impact on Society
§
Panic and confusion
§
Loss of trust in institutions
§
Harm to individuals or 
communities
§
Social and political instability
§
Destroyed reputations
Jurisdiction & International Issues
Cybercrimes often cross borders, 
making investigation and prosecution 
complex.
1. Borderless Nature of Cybercrime
A single attack may involve:
§
Victim in one country
§
Criminal in another
§
Servers in a third
§
Payment routed through a fourth
This makes enforcement complicated.
2. Where Can Someone Be Tried?
Questions that arise:
§
Which country’s laws apply?
§
Where was the offence 
“committed”?
§
Where is the impact felt?
§
Where is the attacker located?
Different countries have different 
standards for evidence, privacy, and 
digital searches.
3. Extradition Challenges
If a criminal flees or operates from 
another country:
§
Local authorities cannot directly 
arrest them
§
Extradition requires formal 
agreements (Extradition Treaty)
§
Both countries must recognize the 
act as a crime
§
Investigations require international 
cooperation
Without treaties, legal action becomes 
very difficult.
4. Extraterritorial Claims
Some countries claim jurisdiction even 
when:
§
The attacker is outside their borders
§
The victim is a citizen abroad
§
The attack targeted national 
infrastructure
This is common in:
§
Large-scale fraud
§
Terror-related cyber offences
§
Attacks on government systems
§
Abuse of citizens using foreign 
platforms
5. Practical Challenges in Real Cases
§
Servers located in multiple 
countries
§
Platforms not cooperating with 
foreign law enforcement
§
Anonymous or VPN-masked 
attackers
§
Cryptocurrency payments hard to 
trace
§
Different privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, 
etc.)
What Is PECA? (Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016)
PECA 2016 is Pakistan’s primary cybercrime law.
It defines what counts as electronic offences, how investigations work, and what penalties 
apply.
Why PECA Was Created
§ Rapid increase in cybercrimes (hacking, fraud, harassment)
§ Protect citizens from online harm
§ Regulate misuse of digital identities and data
§ Provide legal backing to prosecute online offences
§ Strengthen national cybersecurity and protect critical systems
Who Enforces It?
§ FIA Cyber Crime Wing
§ Special Investigation Teams
§ Designated courts for electronic crimes

Criticism on PECA
§ Critics say the bill is too harsh, with punishments that do not fit crimes
§ The bill's language leaves it open to abuse by LEAs, agencies, the government
§ Recommendations of stakeholders were ignored in the formulation of the law
§ It restricts freedom of expression and access to information
§ The offences are too numerous, overlap with other existing laws
§ The wording of the bill leaves many clauses open to interpretation
§ The bill specifically can be misused to target journalists’ sources and whistleblowers
§ Criteria for surveillance is even more open-ended than in the Fair Trial Act 2013
§ Mechanisms for implementation are missing from this bill
§ The bill has introduced clauses on cyberterrorism, which is not the subject of the bill
§ The authority designated under the new law should have been independent of the 
executive
§ The authority has been given sweeping powers to blocking and destroy online material, 
without a court order
§ It does not adequately differentiate cyber crime from cyber terrorism and cyber warfar
